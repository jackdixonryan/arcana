Arcana is a dangerous place full of dangerous things, but it can also be wonderful and amazing. The difference between the two experiences all comes down to you. I'm going to give you a body and a voice to enter the world, but everything after that is up to you. Are you ready to begin?"

I'm hoping that you, as my emissary, will be able to help me figure out what's wrong. The creatures of my world are too short lived, though I love them, and they lack the ability to figure all of this out within their lifetimes. You will have to adapt to many roles along this journey, live in many bodies, and endure many different kinds of things.")
